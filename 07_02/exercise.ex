defmodule Exercise do
    @moduledoc """
    This module contains an exercise for you. Use what you have learned about if/else
    control structures in Elixir.

    Your exercise is to complete the functions in the module.

    magic_of_three/0
    This function should take the list of unicode numbers and
        - sort it
        - return the first three elements

    magic_of_red/0
    This function should take the list of unicode numbers  and
        - only return the red x's

    magic_of_green/0
    This function should take the list of unicode numbers  and
        - use reduce/3 to only return the green check marks

    magic_of_reduce/0
    This function take the list of unicode numbers and
        - return a new list where the red x's have been replaced with the greek symbol omega

    To test your code, run test/0.
