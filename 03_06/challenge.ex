  @moduledoc """
  This module contains a challenge for you. Use what you have learned about data types and operators
  in Elixir to solve this challenge.

  Your challenge is to complete the two functions in the module.

  multiplier/2
  This function should take two digits as arguments, multiply them together, and return the product.

  multiplier/3
  This function should take three digits as arguments, multiply them together, and return the product.

  Hint: remember that in Elixir, functions return the value of the last line in the function block,
  the line before `end`.
