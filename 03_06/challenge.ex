defmodule Challenge do
  @moduledoc """
  This module contains a challenge for you. Use what you have learned about data types and operators
  in Elixir to solve this challenge.

  Your challenge is to complete the two functions in the module.

  multiplier/2
  This function should take two digits as arguments, multiply them together, and return the product.

  multiplier/3
  This function should take three digits as arguments, multiply them together, and return the product.

  If you run this module as it is, you will get an error when you compile. The error will
  state: "warning: this clause cannot match because a previous clause at line 21 always matches".
  This error is tell you that, at the moment, the two functions are the same and will therefore
  always return the same results. We will learn more about how functions are a part of matching
  in Elixir in the the chapter on Pattern Matching. The warning will go away once you have
  solved the challenge and given each of the functions a different arity.

  Hint: remember that in Elixir, functions return the value of the last line in the function block,
  the line before `end`.
